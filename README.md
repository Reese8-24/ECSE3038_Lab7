# ECSE3038_lab7
This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing a WiFi enabled embedded dev module as part of an IoT system and RESTful API server. The final part of the system you're meant to build, you'll have to send status updates from each deployed tank. Your goal is to design a circuit based on an Espressif based development module (ESP32).

Your embedded system should continuously send POST requests to your server from the embedded circuit. 
Your POST request should send a JSON object as payload.
